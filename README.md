# Event_Scheduler
Event Scheduler software created based on a client-server architecture where client can login/register on the server. Once registered they can book time slots for any free classroom(s) on a particular day as per availability displayed to them. The client sends a booking request to the server for a particular venue and date/time slot and the server, which may have received multiple requests for the same venue, selects booking of one request on some basis(e.g. First come first serve) and sends failure response to the others.  
Software developed using JAVA Swings for the GUI,Java Sockets for the Client-Server Connectivity,MySQL for the Database, JDBC for database connectivity.
